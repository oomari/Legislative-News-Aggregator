    - [x] _**Filter News**_ - Allow users to filter news by state (e.g., California, Indiana) and/or by topic (e.g., education, health).
    - [x] _**Search Articles**_ - Implement a simple search functionality to find news articles by keywords in the title or description.
    - [x] _**News Aggregation**_ - 
        - [x] Simulate fetching news articles from an external API or a local dataset. You can use dummy data or an actual news API (like the News API or any other Public News API from this list).
        - [x] For **news aggregation**, simulate the process of pulling news from multiple sources (you can create a script that runs periodically or allow for manual article  addition via an API).
- [x] **Back-End (**Implement the following API endpoints)
    - [x] **GET /news?state=x&topic=y&search=keyword**: Retrieve a list of news articles filtered by state, topic, or search keywords.
    - [x] **GET /news/**: Retrieve detailed information about a specific news article.
    - [ ] **POST /news **(optional): Simulate the ability to add new articles to the system (useful for testing how new data is integrated).
- [x] **Data Storage**
    - [x] Use an in-memory store like **SQLite**, **Redis**, or a simple database(**MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**) to store news articles with relevant metadata.
- [x] **README**
    - [x] _**News Aggregation**_** **- Describe in your README how you would aggregate news articles from multiple sources. How would you handle deduplication, store articles, and ensure fresh data?
    - [x] _**Scalability**_** **- Discuss how the system could handle thousands of news articles across multiple states and topics. Would you index the articles? What storage strategies would you use?
    - [x] _**Search Optimization**_** **- Consider how you would make searching through potentially large datasets efficient.
- [x] **Performance and Caching **
    - [ ] Implement basic caching for news articles to avoid repeatedly fetching or processing the same data, especially if simulating API calls or fetching from an external source.
    - [x] Discuss or implement pagination for the news list if there are many articles.
- [ ] **Security Considerations (Optional)**
    - [ ] Ensure that user input for filtering and searching is properly sanitized to avoid injection attacks.
    - [ ] (Optional) Implement rate-limiting on the news fetching endpoints to prevent abuse.
- [ ] **Bonus Points (Optional Features)**
    - [ ] _**Real-time Updates**_** **- Simulate real-time updates to the news list to notify users when new articles are published.
    - [ ] _**User Personalization**_ - Implement a way for users to save their preferred states and topics, so they automatically see relevant articles when they return to the site.
    - [ ] _**Newsletter Subscription**_ - Allow users to subscribe to a daily email summary of the latest news articles related to their saved states/topics.
- [ ] **Submission** 
    - [ ] Submit the project via **GitHub**, with a clear **README **that includes setup instructions, a description of the system design, and notes on scalability and performance considerations.
    - [x] Please make assumptions, if something is not clear and communicate those assumptions clearly in README or code comments.
    - [x] Include any advanced features or extra details on how the system could be improved.
